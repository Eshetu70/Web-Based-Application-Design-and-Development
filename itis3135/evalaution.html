        <li>Evalautions: <ul>
            <li>It has consistency, is simple, and gets straight to the point.</li>
            <li>It needs work on contrast and combining colors, so your web pages become more distinct and have a great look.</li>
            <li>Make sure all pages are consistency in terms of margining and spacing.</li>
            <li> Justifying the paragraph and increasing the little bit size make it easily readable.</li>
            <li>Nice Job!</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Peer Review 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Name: Naseem Rammounieh</li>
        <li> Website : <a href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/nrammoun/itis3135/"> webpages</a></li>
        <li>Evalautions: <ul>
            <li>The website has no consistency, and you need to ensure it is consistent.</li>
            <li>It needs to work on contrasting and combining colors; your webpages become distinct and look great.</li>
            <li>Make sure all pages are consistent in terms of margining and spacing.</li>
            <li> It would be best if you had worked on hover or text decoration.</li>
            <li>I prefer if you change the serif or font family.</li>
            <li>Margin your main from left and right and remove underline and text decoration from your navbar.</li>
            <li>Overall I like your website!</li>
        </ul>
